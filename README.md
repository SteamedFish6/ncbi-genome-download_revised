# ncbi-genome-download_revised
A revised ncbi_genome_download tool that can set a maximum number of sequences to be downloaded.

Add one argument called '-D' ('--max-download' ) which sets a maximum number of download candidates.

To apply the changes, just replace 'core.py' and 'config.py' in your 'ncbi_genome_download' package to the revised ones.

Please see the origingal tool at: https://github.com/kblin/ncbi-genome-download .
